<p>Fri3d Camp is a family friendly hacker camp for hackers, makers and DIY'ers. It takes place every two years. 2020 will be our fourth edition.</p>

<h2>What to expect?</h2>
<p>Fri3d Camp is an interesting mix of technology festival, easy-going camping atmosphere, and a hacker convention.</p>
<p>We take our inspiration from the large European hacker camps like <a href="https://events.ccc.de/camp/">CCC Camp</a> and <a href="https://sha2017.org/">SHA</a>.</p>

<p>At Fri3d Camp, the distinction between orga and participants is rather vague. For instance, we expect all participants to work at least one shift in content support, at the bar, etc. Apart from that, you'll notice that people are very supportive and always ready to lend a helping hand at Fri3d Camp. Our motto is, after all, '<a href="/deelnemen/excellent">Be Excellent to Each other</a>'</p>

<p>Fri3d Camp wants to reach families. This means that about a third of participants are children. We see them as full-fledged participants, and want to offer challenging science- and technology-oriented activities.</p>
<p>It's the <a href="/cfp">participants themselves</a> who organise all the activities at Fri3d Camp. During previous editions, we cast aluminium, launched a weather balloon, played a high-tech treasure hunt... Fri3d Camp is a playground for anyone interested in science and technology.</p>

<p>We camp out in the woods. Our location is not a congress centre or event hall, but a large wooded camping ground. This creates a relaxed summer atmosphere. At the same time, we have lots of smartphones, laptops and all kinds of high- and low-tech.</p>
<p>We encourage all participants to bring their own projects and to talk about them. Ad-hoc spontaneous workshops and talks are a frequent occurence at Fri3d Camp.</p>

<h2 class="block__ttl">Call for Participation</h2>
<p>You're still able to  <a href="/en/cfp">submit an activity</a> for Fri3d Camp 2020! Your proposal doesn't even have to be a talk or workshop. Maybe you want to install a system of pneumatic tubes, build an art installation, organise a high-tech treasure hunt, build a huge geodesic dome,... We're open to all of your crazy ideas and look forward to help you realize them.</p>

<p>You're now able to  <a href="/en/cfp">submit an activity</a> for Fri3d Camp 2020! Your proposal doesn't even have to be a talk or workshop. Maybe you want to install a system of pneumatic tubes, build an art installation, organise a high-tech treasure hunt, build a huge geodesic dome,... We're open to all of your crazy ideas and look forward to help you realize them.</p>

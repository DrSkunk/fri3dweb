<h2>The location</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.hopper.be/nl/jeugdverblijf/de-kluis">De Kluis</a> is a large campsite where many youth-movements have their camps simultaneously. From <strong>the 14th to the 16th of August</strong> this entire campsite is dedicated to Fri3d Camp. There are sanitary buildings on site, lots of open space to put your tent, campervan, caravan or hijacked UFO, and many trees under which to find shade or to decorate with lights.</p>

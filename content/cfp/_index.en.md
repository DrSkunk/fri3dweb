<div class="block--centered">
<p>All <strong>science- and technology-themed</strong> activities are welcomed. Especially projects you are working on, skills you want to teach others, and passions you'd like to share. There's room for activities of <strong>all experience and skill levels</strong>. You can use another language than Dutch for your activity, but please mention it in your proposal.</p>

<p>Your idea <strong>doesn't have to be a traditional workshop or talk</strong>, we welcome every idea! You could also build a system of pneumatic tubes, organise a high-tech treasure hunt, build a huge geodesic dome... We're open to all kinds of ideas, and we'd love to see how we can help you make them a reality!</p>
